        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's a fried egg. Can't get much simpler than this. If you can't cook this you should probably stick to fast food from now on, just saying.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>
                Once pan has heated, crack open the egg and allow its contents to fall onto the pan.
                <ul><li>(OPTIONAL): For a crunchier experience, consider also adding the eggshell to the pan.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once the egg appears to be solid on the bottom, flip the egg with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Give the egg like 15 seconds, then remove the egg from the heat.</li>
            <li>Consume Egg.</li>
        </ol>
